# SFMesh Controller

This project aims to create an API on top of kubernetes to create, manage Azure Service Fabric Mesh resources using Custom Resource Definations (CRD's). 

Users will be able to use the kubernetes declarative API that they know and love to manage Azure Service Fabric Mesh Resources.

The initial Goal is to allow the management of Service Fabric Mesh Resources only in Azure but once the API gets finalised and the relevant documentation of Service Fabric Mesh API is out. Users should be able to manage, Mesh resources on any Service Fabric Cluster be in Azure, On-Prem, etc.

The project is still in its initial stages and is on hold right now, as the azure sfmesh api is going through a lot of changes being in preview. Once the API is finalised and the offering is in GA, expect a lot of movement in this repo.
